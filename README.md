This is my personal portfolio website built using **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **GSAP**, and **Framer Motion**.

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my skills and projects as a software engineer. The site focuses on a clean, modern design with smooth animations and interactivity powered by GSAP and Framer Motion.

Currently, the website contains two main sections:

- **Home** — Introduction and overview.
- **About** — Background and skills summary.

The project is a work in progress, with responsive design being a major upcoming feature to ensure a great experience across all devices.

## Features

- Developed using React and Vite for fast and efficient frontend development.
- Styled entirely with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI building.
- Smooth, visually appealing animations created using GSAP and Framer Motion.
- Modular React components designed for scalability and maintainability.
- Easy to extend by adding more sections like Portfolio, Skills, Contact, and Blog.

## Current Limitations

- The website is currently **not responsive** and may not display optimally on smaller devices.
- Only the Home and About sections are implemented.
- Additional pages and features such as contact forms, portfolio galleries, and blog sections will be added in future updates.

    npm install
    ```
3. Run the development server:
    ```bash

    ```
4. Open the URL provided in your browser to view the site.

## Future Plans

- Implement full responsive design for mobile and tablet devices.
- Add more sections such as Portfolio, Skills, Contact, and Blog.
- Optimize animations and load times.
- Improve accessibility and SEO.
- Possibly deploy to a custom domain with continuous integration.
